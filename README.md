Hello to whoever is reading this. This is my fourth project, I'm modeling a landing page for a person who customizes and sells classical guitars. This is a simple project and lacks a checkout function due to ignorance. I have created a solution though, a call form. I find it classical and simple, yet still functional.
This project will demonstrate the following skills:

1.Basic understanding and execution of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2.Creating a repository on GitHub for this site.

3.Creating a folder structure to support the web page.

4.Linking the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files together using link and script tags.

5.Adding the HTML content of: nav-bar, imbedded video, product description, and a form which gathers a clients information.

6.CSS styling such as: a flixed nav bar, font families and font sizes. Flex display columns with centered positioning and proper responsiveness. In-site linked buttons which jump you to different sections of a page, Responsive nav-bar with a media query which is activated with JavaScript.

7.Staging, commiting and pushing current progress to GitHub.

Although simple, I enjoyed creating this website a lot. It's my first website that has to do with a product page.

Thank you for reading :)

Hope you enjoy!
